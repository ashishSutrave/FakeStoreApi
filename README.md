# FakeStore API Automation Framework

API test automation for [FakeStore API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) — cart, products, and authentication.

## Framework Choice

**Playwright + TypeScript** was selected because:

- **Native API support** — `APIRequestContext` handles HTTP without a browser, keeping tests fast and lightweight.
- **Single toolchain** — test runner, parallel execution, fixtures, snapshots, and HTML reporting in one framework (no Postman/Newman or separate REST client).
- **Type safety** — TypeScript interfaces and compile-time checks reduce runtime errors in a growing suite.
- **CI-ready** — built-in reporters, retries, and GitHub Actions integration with minimal setup.
- **Scalable pattern** — API Client classes (POM equivalent) keep tests readable as coverage grows.

**AJV** validates JSON response contracts. **Playwright snapshots** provide contract testing for product responses.

## CI vs Local Testing

FakeStore API sits behind **Cloudflare**. GitHub Actions runners are blocked with `403` / `cf-mitigated: challenge` when hitting the live API — this is a firewall issue, not a credentials or header problem.


| Environment        | Mode                   | Command                           |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Local**          | Live API (default)     | `npm test` or `npm run test:live` |
| **Local**          | Mocked API             | `npm run test:mock`               |
| **GitHub Actions** | Mocked API (automatic) | `npm test` when `CI=true`         |


In CI, `ApiHelper` returns fixture-based mock responses (`fixtures/mockApiData.json`) so the full suite validates framework logic, schemas, and snapshots without calling the real API.

Locally, tests hit **[https://fakestoreapi.com](https://fakestoreapi.com)** for true end-to-end coverage.

## Assignment Coverage


| Requirement                           | Implementation                                                               |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cart CRUD (POST / GET / PUT / DELETE) | `tests/cart/cart-crud.spec.ts`                                               |
| Positive & negative cases             | `cart-crud.spec.ts` + `cart-negative.spec.ts`                                |
| Authentication                        | `tests/auth/auth.spec.ts` + authenticated cart access in `cart-crud.spec.ts` |
| Response schema validation            | AJV schemas in `schemas/` — applied on cart, auth, and product responses     |
| Data-driven test (3+ product IDs)     | Product GET for IDs **1–5** in `tests/product/product.spec.ts`               |
| Contract / snapshot test (senior)     | Product response snapshots + schema validation in `product.spec.ts`          |


**31 tests** across auth, cart, and product suites.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install
cp .env.example .env
npm test                  # live API (local)
npm run test:mock         # mocked API (same as CI)
npm run test:live         # explicit live API run
npm run test:report       # open HTML report
```

**Environment variables:** `BASE_URL`, `API_USERNAME`, `API_PASSWORD`, `WORKERS`, `MOCK_API`, `STRICT_RESPONSE_TIME_MS`, `MAX_RESPONSE_TIME_MS` (see `.env.example`).

## Project Layout

```
api/          → AuthApi, CartApi, ProductApi (API Client pattern)
tests/        → auth, cart, product test suites
schemas/      → AJV JSON schemas (cart, login, product)
fixtures/     → test data, mock responses, Playwright custom fixtures
utils/        → apiHelper, mockApiRouter, logger, schemaValidator
```



## Reporting & Parallelisation


| Capability              | Status                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Console (list) reporter | Enabled                                                                |
| Playwright HTML report  | `playwright-report/` — `npm run test:report`                           |
| JSON results            | `test-results/results.json`                                            |
| Parallel workers        | `WORKERS` in `.env` (use `1` on Windows if workers crash)              |
| CI/CD                   | GitHub Actions — mocked tests on push/PR, uploads HTML report artifact |




## Extension Plan


- Allure reporting, test tagging (`@smoke` / `@regression`), Docker for consistent environments
- Users API coverage, Faker.js test data factories, OpenAPI spec validation
- Self-hosted CI runner for live API in pipeline, k6 performance tests, Slack/CI notifications
